               <h2>ChatGPT opened to the public on November 30, 2022. The AI chat machine, backed by Microsoft as an investor, has attracted a lot of attention since its launch. In its first two months, ChatGPT was used by more than 100 million users, giving Microsoft a glimpse of how ChatGPT could play an important role in the future of our daily lives.
                  Microsoft made an announcement on their website on March 16, 2023, stating that they plan t
                  o incorporate ChatGPT into their office software in the coming days. <br> <br> The program will be called 
                  Microsoft 365 Copilot, which combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with business data and Microsoft 
                  365 applications. <br> <br> The Copilot is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 technology and will feature in the sidebar as a chatbot in 
                  Microsoft 365 apps. It aims to boost productivity, creativity, and skills by transforming words into a potent productivity tool. Microsoft 365 Copilot is 
                  not just a novel work methodology, but a tool to revolutionize productivity.

            With its recent 1.5 billion investment in OpenAI's ChatGPT,
            Microsoft is releasing a new co-pilot designed for its office 360 products.

               By utilizing the copilot function available in Microsoft Word, you can benefit from its capabilities to write, edit, summarize, and create documents.  <br>  <br>
               With a simple prompt, Copilot generates an initial draft for you and incorporates relevant information from your organization. Copilot has the ability to append content to an existing document, condense text, and rephrase either sections or the entirety of a document to enhance its concision. <br> <br> Furthermore, Copilot can assist you in refining your writing skills by proposing strategies to fortify your arguments and eradicate any inconsistencies.</h2>

            In terms of Microsoft Outlook, we often struggle with the reading and response time generated by the sheer volume of email in our daily life, but the Copilot feature in Outlook can help reduce the time we spend on email triage and increase our productivity in communication.

 It can summarize complex email threads involving multiple people, allowing us to grasp different perspectives and unanswered questions. The feature also offers prompts and toggles that can be used to quickly respond to emails or turn quick notes into professional messages using content from across Microsoft 365.

<h2 class = "watch-out">WATCH OUT: Copilot cannot always correctly understand contexts and dates - always check for accuracy.</h2>
For example, you can write in the copilot function: “Write an email to Microsoft for beta access to their copilot.”and  it will give us the following response:

               Currently, copilot will only be accessible on five Microsoft-owned products. It's already evident that having a copilot tool can greatly benefit our line of work by saving time and improving our overall experience. Looking ahead, there's a strong likelihood that AI such as ChatGPT will transform our daily lives, potentially replacing traditional text input with voice and AI interactions. However, until then, we should be prepared for the possibility of unexpected developments that surpass our current understanding.      </article>

The funding was intended to help OpenAI further its mission of advancing AI in a responsible and safe manner. In 2019, OpenAI raised $1 billion in a new investment round led by Microsoft, with participation from investors such as Reid Hoffman's Greylock Partners, Founders Fund, and Sequoia Capital. The funding was intended to help OpenAI continue its research into artificial intelligence while also ensuring that it is developed in an ethical and responsible way. In June 2020, OpenAI announced that it had raised $100 million in funding from a group of investors led by Greg Brockman, the CEO of OpenAI. Other investors included LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Khosla Ventures, and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. The funding was intended to help OpenAI expand its team and continue its research efforts."
