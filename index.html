                  ChatGPT opened to the public on November 30, 2022. The AI chat machine, backed by Microsoft as an investor, has attracted a lot of attention since its launch. In its first two months, ChatGPT was used by more than 100 million users, giving Microsoft a glimpse of how ChatGPT could play an important role in the future of our daily lives.
                  Microsoft made an announcement on their website on March 16, 2023, stating that they plan to incorporate ChatGPT into their office software in the coming days. <br> <br> Microsoft has bet the farm on ChatGPT, having missed out on countless other trends.  In the pursuit of producing a new product as quickly as possible, Microsoft has fired its ethics team...

                  Currently, the co-pilot feature is solely accessible on five products owned by Microsoft. Undoubtedly, integrating a co-pilot tool in our workflow can significantly enhance our productivity, efficiency, and overall user experience. Nevertheless, there are numerous intricacies, such as design, language, and functionality that require further refinement before the tool can become fully operational.
                  Looking towards the future, advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), like ChatGPT, hold the potential to revolutionize our daily lives. We could potentially see a shift away from traditional text input towards more intuitive voice and AI interactions. However, until such innovations become mainstream, we should remain vigilant of potential unexpected developments beyond our current understanding.
