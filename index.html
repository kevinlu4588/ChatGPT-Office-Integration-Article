var text = ["OpenAI was founded in December 2015 with an initial funding of $1 billion from its founders, which included Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Wojciech Zaremba. In February 2018, OpenAI announced that it had raised an additional $1 billion in funding from a group of investors that included Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, and Khosla Ventures. The funding was intended to help OpenAI further its mission of advancing AI in a responsible and safe manner. In 2019, OpenAI raised $1 billion in a new investment round led by Microsoft, with participation from investors such as Reid Hoffman's Greylock Partners, Founders Fund, and Sequoia Capital. The funding was intended to help OpenAI continue its research into artificial intelligence while also ensuring that it is developed in an ethical and responsible way. In June 2020, OpenAI announced that it had raised $100 million in funding from a group of investors led by Greg Brockman, the CEO of OpenAI. Other investors included LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Khosla Ventures, and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. The funding was intended to help OpenAI expand its team and continue its research efforts."]
